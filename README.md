#### Datasets Used
The travel dataset provides detailed information on various trips taken by travelers, including their destination, travel dates, duration of the trip in days, traveler demographics (name, age, gender, and nationality), as well as the type and cost of accommodation and transportation. This dataset can be used to gain insights into travel patterns, preferences, and behaviors of different types of travelers.
